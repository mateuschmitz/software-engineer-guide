# Software Engineer's Guide

> A curated list of topics, tools and resources to software engineers and beginner programmers

This repo may be used as a guide to study and learn more about algorithms, data structures, calculus, programming languages and many other important subjects related to software engineering. Some contents are beginners, others advanced and others are just by curiosity and can be ignored if you don't like them.

The topics listed here are those that I judge relevant to knowing/mastering, feel free to fork and modify your list with the content you think more relevant or interesting.

This work was inspired by [John Washam](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) and has as objective improve my skills and turn me a better software engineer too.

*Good luck*
